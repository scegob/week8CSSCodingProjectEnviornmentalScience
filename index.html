           The 3 scientific principles of sustainability
           <ol>
            <li>Solar Energy</li>
            <p>
                The sun's energy warms the planet and provides energy that plants
                use to produce <b>nutrients</b>, the chemical that plants and animals need to survive
            </p>
            <li>Biodiversity</li>
            <p>
                The variety of genes, species, ecosystems and ecosystem processes are referred to
                as <b>biodiversity</b>. Interactions among species provide vital ecosystem services provide
                vital ecosystem services and keep and population from growing too large. Biodiversity
                also provides ways for species to adapt to changing enviornmental conditions and for new
                species to arise and replace those wiped out by catastrophic enviornmenental changes.
            </p>
            <li>Chemical Cycling</li>
            <p>
                The circulation of nutrients from the enviornment through various organisms and back to the enviornment
                is called <b>chemical cyling</b> or <b>nutrient cycling</b>. The earth receives a 
                continuous supply of energy from the sun but it receives no new supplies of life-supporting chemicals.
                Through billions of years of interactions with their living and nonliving enviornment, organisms have 
                developed ways to recylce the chemicals they need to survive. This means that the wastes and decayed bodies
                of organisms become nutrients or raw materials for other organisms. In nature, <b>waste = useful resources</b>.
