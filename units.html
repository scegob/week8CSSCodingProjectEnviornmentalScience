            <h3>Unit 1 overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the principle of exponential growth</li>
                <p>Exponential growth and doubling time: The rule of 70
                the doubling time for the human population is 70 years.
                Doubling time (years) = 70/annual growth rate %
                The population is growth at about 1.21% per year.
                </p>
                <li>Distinguish between renewable and non-renewable resources</li>
                <p>
                <b>Renewable resources:</b> Resource that can be used repeatedly because it is 
                replenished through natural processes as long as it is not used up faster than
                nature can regrow it
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Nonrenewable resources:</b> Those that exist in a fixed amount or stock in the 
                earth's crust. They take millions to billions of years to form through geological 
                processes
                </p>
                <li>Describe our impact as a species</li>
                <p>
                Human activities can degrade natural capital. Most developed countries with 17%
                of the world population use 70% of the earth's resources. Less developed countires
                are about 83% of the world's population but only use 30% of the earth's resources.
                If everyone in the world lived like that average american then we will need 5 planet earths.
                <br>
                We do have the ability to change this because the third component of sustainability is people
                finding solutions to the environmental problems we face.
                </p>
                <li>Describe the scientific method</li>
        <!-- Creating a list of steps for the scientific method. -->
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify a problem</li>
                    <li>Find out what is known about the problem (literature search)</li>
                    <li>Ask a question to be investigated</li>
                    <li>Perform an experiment to answer the question and collect data</li>
                    <li>Analyze data (check for patterns) - scientific law (well accepted pattern in data)</li>
                    <li>Propose a hypothesis to explain data</li>
                    <li>Use hypothesis to make testable predictions</li>
                    <li>If hypothesis gets accepted it becomes a <b>scientific theory</b></li>
                    <li>If not, hypothesis will be revised</li>
                    <li>Make testable predictions</li>
                    <li>Test projections</li>
                    <li>It will be either to be revised again or accept the hypothesis</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Explain the first Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy)</li>
                <p>
                Whenever energy is converted from one form to another in a physical or chemical
                 change no nergy is created or destroyed <br><br>

                </p>
                <li>Explain the second law of thermodynamics</li>
                <p>
                Low quality energy usually takes the form of heat that flows into the enviornment. When energy is changed from one 
                form to another it always goes from a more
                useful to a less useful form. <br><br>
