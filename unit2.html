                    Black Bear <br>
                    As omnivores, bears eat a little bit of everything, which helps the forest stay healthy and clean. As bears graze
                    for nuts and seeds throughout the late summer and fall, the undigested seeds are deposited in their droppings, or scat,
                    which then fertilizes them to grow into the giants that visitors come from around the world to see. Even as these giant trees fall, 
                    bears are there to dig through the logs in search of insects inside, helping to make a new forest floor. These new berry bushes and 
                    leafy greens attract elk and deer, as well. As these animals die off, the bears will help to eat the carcasses, providing more nutrients
                    to the soil and building the web of Olympic life! <br><br>
                    These creatures have an incredibly varied diet. They often feed on tree sapwood, young tree bark, and insect mounds until berries come in season.
                    Bears can be spotted frequently in the early fall raiding the huckleberry bushes on mountain slopes. During various salmon runs in both spring and fall,
                    bears will feed in shallow waters where they have a relatively easy time catching salmon en route to spawn, or salmon carcasses that have done so already.

                    Bullfrog <br><br>
                    The original native range of bullfrogs was the eastern United States, but they have been introduced to most of western North America. Bullfrogs were first introduced
                    into Washington during the Great Depression in the early 1930s to provide a food source of frog legs for interested hunters. <br>
                    Adult bullfrogs usually are "sit and wait" predators that readily attack almost any live animal smaller than themselves, including insects, frogs, tadpoles, fish,
                    small snakes, turtle hatchlings, newts, salamanders, bats, hummingbirds, and ducklings. Bullfrogs use their sticky tongues to subdue prey, but that's not their only
                    method of securing food. Large frogs are more likely to lunge at their targets. Once they get a grip with their wide, sturdy jaws, they use their front feet to shove
                    the items down their gullets. <br>

                    <b>Keystone</b>
                    The enormous benefit that salmon provide for countless species and the overall health and Function
                    of the coast is what makes a salmon a keystone species. <br><br>
                    <b>Salmon feed our coast</b> <br>
                    They feed land mammals, birds, marine mammals and our forests. <br>
                    <a href="https://pacificwild.org/salmon-a-keystone-species/">Salmon: A Keystone Species</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pacific salmon are mostly anadromous, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean,
                    and then migrate back to freshwater, spawn and die immediately after. On their journey to the ocean,
                    more than 50 per cent of their diet is insects which fall into streams from surrounding tree canopies
                    (Allan et al. 2003, Baxter et al. 2005). <br> Without Pacific salmon, there would be the potential for an explosion of insects,
                    as salmon are the main insect predator in aquatic environments. When salmon return to their native streams to spawn,
                    their energy-rich carcasses and eggs are consumed by a variety of predators in coastal watersheds, including wolves, bears, and scavenging birds.
